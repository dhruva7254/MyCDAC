R-Programming Notes:

The R Project for Statistical Computing:

  R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.) and graphical techniques.
R is open-source and freely available under the GNU General Public License.

Why R:
  
  R is widely used in academia and industry for statistical analysis, data visualization, and data science.
It has a large and active user community, which contributes to its extensive collection of packages and resources.
R provides powerful tools for data manipulation, exploration, and modeling.
It offers a wide range of graphical capabilities for creating publication-quality plots and visualizations.

Introduction & Installation of R:

  R can be downloaded and installed from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website.
Installation packages are available for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
The installation process typically involves downloading the installer package and following the installation instructions provided on the CRAN website.

R Basics:

  R is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line.
It has a command-line interface where users can enter commands interactively or execute scripts stored in text files.
R uses a syntax similar to other programming languages but with its own unique conventions and functions.

Finding Help:

  R provides extensive documentation and help resources to assist users.
The help() function can be used to access documentation for specific functions or topics.
The ? operator followed by a function or topic name can also be used to access help directly from the command line.

Code Editors for R:
  
  Various code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) are available for writing and executing R code.
Popular choices include RStudio, Visual Studio Code with R extensions, and Jupyter Notebooks with R kernels.

Exploring R GUI:

  R comes with a built-in graphical user interface (GUI) that provides basic functionality for interacting with R.
The R GUI includes menus, toolbars, and windows for viewing plots, data objects, and help documentation.
While the R GUI is functional, many users prefer using more feature-rich IDEs like RStudio for their R programming needs.

Exploring RStudio:

  RStudio is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming.
It provides a user-friendly interface with features such as code editing, debugging, workspace management, and integrated documentation.
RStudio also includes tools for version control, package management, and project organization, making it a comprehensive environment for R development.

Basic Mathematical & Arithmetic Operations in R:

  R supports all standard arithmetic operations, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (^).
Parentheses can be used to control the order of operations, similar to standard mathematical notation.
R also provides built-in functions for more complex mathematical operations, such as square roots (sqrt()), absolute values (abs()), and trigonometric functions (sin(), cos(), tan()).
These notes provide an overview of the topics covered in Session 19 of R-Programming. They introduce the R project, discuss the reasons for using R, cover the installation process, explore basic R operations, and introduce popular code editors and IDEs for R development.
