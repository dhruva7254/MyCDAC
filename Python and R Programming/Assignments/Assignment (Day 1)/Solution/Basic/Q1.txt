Q1. What are components of a computer ?


A computer system consists of several components, each playing a specific role in processing data. 
Here are the key components of a typical computer:

Central Processing Unit (CPU): Often referred to as the brain of the computer, the CPU executes 
instructions stored in computer programs. It performs arithmetic, logic, and control operations.

Memory (RAM): Random Access Memory (RAM) is temporary storage that the CPU uses to store data and 
instructions while processing. It provides fast access to data but is volatile, meaning it loses its 
contents when the computer is turned off.

Storage Devices: These devices are used for long-term storage of data and programs. Common types 
include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs), and optical drives (like CD/DVD drives).

Motherboard: The motherboard is the main circuit board of the computer, providing connectivity between 
all the components. It houses the CPU, memory modules, and other essential components.

Input Devices: These devices allow users to input data and commands into the computer. Examples include 
keyboards, mice, touchpads, and microphones.

Output Devices: Output devices display or provide results generated by the computer. Examples include 
monitors (or screens), printers, speakers, and headphones.

Peripheral Devices: These devices extend the functionality of the computer beyond basic input and 
output. Examples include external hard drives, USB flash drives, webcams, and scanners.

Power Supply Unit (PSU): The PSU converts electrical power from an outlet into usable power for the 
computer's components. It supplies power to the motherboard, CPU, and other components.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): The GPU is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations. 
It's essential for tasks like gaming, video editing, and graphical design.

Cooling System: Computers generate heat during operation, so cooling systems (such as fans and heat 
sinks) are necessary to prevent overheating and ensure optimal performance.

These components work together to enable the functionality of a computer, allowing users to perform 
various tasks, from simple word processing to complex computational simulations and graphics rendering.
